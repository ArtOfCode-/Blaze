Blaze
=====
[Blaze](http://www.erwaysoftware.com/blaze/) is a web application that displays recent content (answers, questions and comments) on a Stack Exchange site. You can use it to check for potential low-quality content on sites.

To get started, enter a site name in the textbox (such as `stackoverflow`, `softwarerecs`, ...) and you'll get a list of recent answers/questions/comments.

A Blaze account gives you the opportunity to flag posts using a "flag" link. Flagging a post will post a link to the answer in our chatroom. [Example chat message](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19640151#19640151). Note that this will not generate an actual flag on the site.

If you use the "Authenticate" link at the top of the page, you can give Blaze access to flag a post on the site itself; a "flag on site" link will appear. When clicking on that one, you get a dialog for the flag reasons. When you select one, Blaze will flag the post on the site through your Stack Exchange account.
